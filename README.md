# Firebase App is undefined despite correct configuration
This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase initialization issue where the `app` object remains undefined even after providing the correct configuration. The issue is often related to improper Firebase setup or conflicts with other libraries.

## Bug Description
The `initializeApp` function from Firebase returns undefined instead of the initialized app object, causing all subsequent Firebase operations to fail.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the configuration object's correctness, checking for conflicts with other libraries and ensuring the Firebase SDK is correctly imported and initialized.
